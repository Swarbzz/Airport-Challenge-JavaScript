# Airport Challenge in JavaScript

```ruby

        _\____\___
=  = ==(____MA____)
          \_____\___________________,-~~~~~~~`-.._
          /     o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o  |\_
          `~-.__       __..----..__                  )

```

## Task

My task was to create a previous Makers Academy that was created with Ruby and re-create it in JavaScript. The tasks for completeing the project are written in the form of user stories below:

```
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport and confirm that it has landed

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
```

## My Approach

Initially i went through my previous file that was written in ruby and looked at my notes and followed or retraced my logical steps. I began with passing the simplest of tests and slowy worked my way forward until i had completed all of the appropriate user stories above. The constant use of TDD through Jasmine was a must to complete this challenge for me. 

## Set up

Please clone my repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:Swarbzz/Airport-Challenge-JavaScript.git
cd Airport-Challenge-JavaScript
```
To see all of my passing tests simply open the SpecRunner:
```
cd jasmine-standalone-3
open SpecRunner.html
```
